       <p>My name is Jerry Bribiesca and I am an IT Manager for a Real Estate Law Firm in Arlington, TX.
           I have been in IT for over 15 years and have worked in a variety of positions across small to large organizations.
           My free time as of late has been consumed by my 6 year old son. He loves to keep us on our toes and keeps Daddy busy with video games!</p>
